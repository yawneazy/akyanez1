        <p>I was born and raised in Tucson, Arizona and have golfed and played music as a child.
            It seemed like the perfect opportunity when Holy Names University located in Oakland, CA,
            offered me a golf scholarship. I was able to study music and earn a Bachelor of Arts degree in 
            Music Composition while competing at the NCAA DII level. While I was there, I found an interest
            in Computer Science although my University didn't offer any coding classes. I wasn't really able to explore
            that area of interest until later in life. After I graduated from HNU in 2018, I worked as a music teacher
            at a small school and realized that education was not the route I wanted to take.
        </p>
              
                <p>I recently decided that I wanted to do front-end development or something 
                    related because of this course. I'm a CS major but I've struggled not only in the major,
                    but also figuring out exactly what I wanted to do with this degree. I have always
                    been more on the creative side so I just felt like this was the perfect fit.
                </p>
