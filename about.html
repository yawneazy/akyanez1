        <p>I was originally born and raised in Tucson, Arizona. I grew up participating in a lot of activities 
            such as music and golf but sticking with those two actually helped me with my first college degree.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was offered a golf scholarship from Holy Names University located in Oakland, CA, and I played NCAA DII golf
            for 4 years in the Bay Area. I felt so blessed to be able to play at such nice courses and to be away from
            my little home in Tucson. Outside of waking up at 5am every morning and practicing several hours a day for golf,
            I was spending other hours of the day playing piano and singing. 
        </p> 
        <p>
            I've always loved music and felt that it was always who I was. So not really thinking about what I wanted to do
            with the degree, I earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Music Composition. My senior year in college, I just felt 
            like something was missing. I was really unsure of what I wanted to do with the degree.
        </p> 
        <p>  
            After researching careers, Software Engineering really made an impression on me. I had no prior coding experience
            but I knew I wanted to try it! I took a class and... failed. and I didn't try again for another 2 years. But after being
            a music teacher at a small school post college, I had a feeling that I needed to try again.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now here I am, studying Computer Science at the University of Arizona and will hopefully be graduating May of 2023. 
            It has been such a challenge but I know that I made the right decision. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Everything in my past has shaped me into who I am today. Competing at the collegiate level for athletics taught
            me to not give up and to be mentally strong. Because of music, I have a creative side which is also really handy 
            for coding projects.
        </p>
